# GFW Help Center

The front end app for the Global Forest Watch Help Center built using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/).

## Installation / setting up locally

Install deps

```bash
yarn
```

Copy the `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and start the server.

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will set up the app running on port 3000.

As the application is deployed under a subpath, you can access all help center content on `http://localhost:3000/help/`.
